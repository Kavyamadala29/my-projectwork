The main objective of this project is to reduce communication barrier between normal people and special person who are not able to make a normal conversation be it a disabled one or dumb and deaf or paralysed.
 As human Beings communicate and know each other through thoughts and ideas. The best way to present your idea is through speech.
 But some people donâ€™t have the power of speech; the only way to communicate with others is through their movements. 
We can say that it is limited to the same set of persons that cannot speak. So, there is a need of technology which reduces this gap through systems that converts movement into speech.
